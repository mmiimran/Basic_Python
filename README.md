      <td>In Python, type conversion means changing data from one type to another using functions like int(), float(), str(), list(), tuple(), dict(), etc. It's crucial for handling different data types and formatting. Python makes it easy with methods for converting between types, allowing flexible data manipulation and formatting.</td>
