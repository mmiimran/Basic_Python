      <td>In Python, variables store data values upon assignment, accommodating diverse data types without explicit type declarations. Operators, symbolically applied, execute operations on operands.</td>

      <td>In Python, type conversion means changing data from one type to another using functions like int(), float(), str(), list(), tuple(), dict(), etc. It's crucial for handling different data types and formatting. Python makes it easy with methods for converting between types, allowing flexible data manipulation and formatting.</td>

      <td>Escape sequences in Python are special characters preceded by a backslash () used to represent challenging characters directly in code. Common ones include newline (\n), tab (\t), carriage return (\r), backslash (), single quote ('), and double quote (").</td>

      <td>The "if" statement in Python executes code only if a condition is true, allowing program flow control. If true, the following code block runs; otherwise, it's skipped. "elif" and "else" handle alternative conditions or fallback actions.</td>

      <td>Indentation in Python denotes a line belonging to a specific block or scope, crucial for structure and hierarchy. It replaces traditional braces, ensuring consistency. Incorrect indentation leads to syntax or logical errors.</td>

      <td>The "if-elif-else" statement in Python checks multiple conditions in sequence. It starts with "if," followed by "elif" for additional checks, and "else" as an optional fallback. The first true condition's block executes, or the "else" block if none match. It's used for handling multiple exclusive conditions.</td>
