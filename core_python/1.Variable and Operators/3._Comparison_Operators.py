# Example of Comparison Operators are given below 

# Less than comparison
# Checking if 7 is less than 2 and printing the result
# print(7<2)
a = 7
b = 2
value = a < b
print(value)

# Greater than comparison
# Checking if 7 is greater than 2 and printing the result
# print(7>2)
a = 7
b = 2
value = a > b
print(value)

# Less than or equal to comparison
# Checking if 7 is less than or equal to 2 and printing the result
# print(7<=2)
a = 7
b = 2
value = a <= b
print(value)

# Greater than or equal to comparison
# Checking if 7 is greater than or equal to 2 and printing the result
# print(7>=2)
a = 7
b = value = a >= b
print(value)

# Equality comparison
# Checking if 7 is equal to 2 and printing the result
# print(7==2)
a = 7
b = 2
value = a == b
print(value)

# Inequality comparison
# Checking if 7 is not equal to 2 and printing the result
# print(7!=2)
a = 7
b = 2
value = a != b
print(value)
